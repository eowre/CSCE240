 * Revisit the Babylonian square root calculation:
 * 1.) Guess at the correct square root (n/2 maybe?)
 * 2.) Calculate root = n / guess
 * 3.) Let guess = (guess + root)/2
 * 4.) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the square root is resolved.
 *
 * This time, however, use a loop and define what it means to be "resolved."
